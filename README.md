## Overview
The main objective is to gain a deep understanding of JavaScript programming. This project covers essential topics such as basic syntax, data structures, functions, object-oriented programming, and advanced concepts like asynchronous programming and Node.js.

## Key Concepts
- <b>JavaScript Basics</b>
  - Introduction to JavaScript syntax and data types.
  - Understanding variables, control structures, and functions.
- <b>Data Structures</b>
  - Arrays and objects.
  - Understanding and manipulating data in JavaScript.
- <b>Object-Oriented Programming</b>
  - Introduction to OOP principles in JavaScript.
  - Understanding prototypes and classes.
- <b>Asynchronous Programming</b>
  - Introduction to callbacks, promises, and async/await.
  - Handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
- <b>Node.js</b>
  - Introduction to Node.js and its ecosystem.
  - Building server-side applications with Node.js.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/maciejwiacek/EloquentJavaScript.git && cd EloquentJavaScript
```
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor or IDE
3. Run JavaScript files using Node.js
```bash
node filename.js
```

## Gained Knowledge:
- Gain a solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.
- Implement and use data structures effectively in programs.
- Develop skills in object-oriented programming and asynchronous operations.
- Understand and apply Node.js for server-side development.

## Project Status
I am currently working through the book and this repository is a collection of my progress. It is not yet complete, and I will continue to update it as I complete more chapters and exercises.
